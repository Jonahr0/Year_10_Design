        My goal when creating this website is to make it easier for people who love music to find multiple artist's most popular/best songs.  I will use the data from a Spotify API to be able to recall each artist's most popular songs. I chose Spotify to conduct my API because it is one of the most popular music streaming apps meaning it contains a lot of data.  My client could be Spotify as they do not have something like this and I feel it would really benefit the user experience of the site. I believe this would help the users of Spotify by giving them the artist's top songs, when the user finds a new artist they want to discover this will save them a lot of trouble so they don't have to listen to every song to see which they think is the best. Personally, I love music and I love listening to music, when I come across a new artist I want to learn about, I feel it would be very helpful to bring up the artist's best songs. In conclusion, I believe my website will help people who love music to discover more about artists that is new to them. The website will also help benefit me when I am looking to discover a new artist since it will exactly layout all of the chosen artist's best songs.
